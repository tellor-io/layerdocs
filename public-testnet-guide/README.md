**In this guide we we'll cover the necessary steps to:**

1. Configure a Tellor Layer node and join the network using setup scripts.
2. Use the node to stake test TRB as a Layer validator and earn rewards.

**Note:** This is a guide for setting up a Tellor Layer public testnet node. Care is taken to provide clarity on the tools being used, but testers should be comfortable with running experimental code via command line interface. A beginnerâ€™s understanding of the cosmos SDK is highly recommended!&#x20;
