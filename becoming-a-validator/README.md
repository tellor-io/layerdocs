# Becoming a Validator

## Overview

### What is a Validator?&#x20;

Validators in the Tellor Layer network play a crucial role in maintaining the blockchain's integrity and consensus. They are responsible for validating transactions, securing the network, and ensuring the proper functioning of the blockchain.

**Responsibilities of a Validator:**

1. **Transaction Validation:** Validators validate transactions and add them to the chain.
2. **Consensus Participation:** They participate in the consensus mechanism to agree on the state of the chain.
3. **Block Proposal:** Validators propose new blocks and ensure that all committed transactions are included.
4. **Signing:** Validators sign aggregated data values, ensuring their correctness before they are relayed to other chains.

**Requirements:**

1. **Staking TRB:** Validators must stake TRB tokens. The amount of TRB staked influences their validator weight.
2. **Hardware and Software:** They need reliable hardware and software to run a full node, participate in consensus, and handle the required computational tasks.
3. **Technical Knowledge:** A good understanding of blockchain technology and the specific requirements of the Tellor Layer network.
4. **Commitment to Uptime:** Validators must ensure high availability and uptime to avoid penalties and maintain the network's stability.

**Risk and Reward:**

* **Rewards:** Validators earn rewards through block proposals, transaction fees, and inflationary rewards. The rewards are proportional to their stake and the accuracy of their work.
* **Risks:** Validators face the risk of slashing, which can occur if they act maliciously, validate incorrect data, or fail to maintain uptime. Slashing results in the loss of a portion or all of their staked TRB tokens. The severity of the penalty depends on the infraction's nature (warning, minor infraction, major infraction).
