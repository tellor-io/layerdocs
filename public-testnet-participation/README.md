# Public Testnet Participation

## Overview

In preparation for Tellor Layer's launch to mainnet we look to the public to test out the chain by becoming a testnet validator and reporter.

### What is a Validator?&#x20;

Validators in the Tellor Layer network play a crucial role in maintaining the blockchain's integrity and consensus. They are responsible for validating transactions, securing the network, and ensuring the proper functioning of the blockchain.  The number of total validators is capped at 100.

**Responsibilities of a Validator:**

1. **Transaction Validation:** Validators validate transactions and add them to the chain.
2. **Consensus Participation:** They participate in the consensus mechanism to agree on the state of the chain.
3. **Block Proposal:** Validators propose new blocks and ensure that all committed transactions are included.
4. **Signing:** Validators sign aggregated data values, ensuring their correctness before they are relayed to other chains.

**Requirements:**

1. **Staking TRB:** Validators must stake TRB tokens. The amount of TRB staked influences their validator weight.
2. **Hardware and Software:** They need reliable hardware and software to run a full node, participate in consensus, and handle the required computational tasks.
3. **Technical Knowledge:** A good understanding of blockchain technology and the specific requirements of the Tellor Layer network.
4. **Commitment to Uptime:** Validators must ensure high availability and uptime to avoid penalties and maintain the network's stability.

## What is a Reporter

Reporters are responsible for submitting data values for various queries on the Tellor Layer network.  As with validators, reporters must also stake to participate and submit data values for rewards. They play the key role in the Tellor Layer chain of providing accurate and timely data, which is aggregated and used by the network.
