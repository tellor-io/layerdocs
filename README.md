# Introduction

## Welcome to the [Tellor Layer Docs](https://docs.tellor.io/layer-docs)

**Tellor Layer** is a stand alone L1 built using the cosmos sdk for the purpose of coming to consensus on any subjective data. It works by using a network of staked parties who are crypto-economically incentivized to honestly report requested data.  For more in-depth information, checkout the [Tellor Layer tech paper](https://github.com/tellor-io/layer/blob/main/TellorLayer%20-%20tech.pdf) and our [ADRs](https://github.com/tellor-io/layer/tree/main/adr).

## [Public Testnet](public-testnet/)

In preparation for Tellor Layer's launch to mainnet we are conducting a public testnet in order to test the processes of [participating as a validator](public-testnet/run-a-layer-node.md) and [reporter](public-testnet/start-a-reporter.md). &#x20;
