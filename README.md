## Introduction

**Tellor Layer** is a stand alone L1 built using the cosmos sdk for the purpose of coming to consensus on any subjective data. It works by using a network of staked parties who are crypto-economically incentivized to honestly report requested data.  For more in-depth information, checkout the [Tellor Layer tech paper](https://github.com/tellor-io/layer/blob/main/TellorLayer%20-%20tech.pdf) and our [ADRs](https://github.com/tellor-io/layer/tree/main/adr).

## Public Testnet

In preparation for Tellor Layer's launch to mainnet we are conducting a public testnet in order to stress test the functions of the chain and the processes of onboarding and participating as a validator and reporter.&#x20;
