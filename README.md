## Introduction

**Tellor Layer** is a stand alone L1 built using the cosmos sdk for the purpose of coming to consensus on any subjective data. It works by using a network of staked parties who are crypto-economically incentivized to honestly report requested data.  For more in-depth information, checkout the [Tellor Layer tech paper](https://github.com/tellor-io/layer/blob/main/TellorLayer%20-%20tech.pdf) and our [ADRs](https://github.com/tellor-io/layer/tree/main/adr).

## Public Testnet

In preparation for Tellor Layer's launch to mainnet we'll be conducting a public testnet in order to stress test the functions of the chain and the processes of onboarding and participating as a validator and reporter.&#x20;

#### What is a Validator?&#x20;

Validators in the Tellor Layer network play a crucial role in maintaining the blockchain's integrity and consensus. They are responsible for validating transactions, securing the network, and ensuring the proper functioning of the blockchain.  The number of total validators is capped at 100.

**Responsibilities of a Validator:**

1. **Transaction Validation:** Validators validate transactions and add them to the chain.
2. **Consensus Participation:** They participate in the consensus mechanism to agree on the state of the chain.
3. **Block Proposal:** Validators propose new blocks and ensure that all committed transactions are included.
4. **Signing:** Validators sign aggregated data values, ensuring their correctness before they are relayed to other chains.
