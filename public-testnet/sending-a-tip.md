# Sending a Tip

For data that is not getting reported as part of the cycle list, a tip is required.

The command for sending a tip looks like this:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# ./layerd tx oracle tip [tipper] [query_data] [amount] [flags]
./layerd tx oracle tip $TELLOR_ADDRESS 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000953706f745072696365000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004757364630000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000037573640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 1000000loya --fees 5loya
