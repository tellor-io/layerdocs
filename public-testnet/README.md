# Public Testnet

## Join the Public Testnet

**In this guide we we'll cover the necessary steps to:**

1. Configure a Tellor Layer node and join the network using setup scripts.
2. Use the node to stake test TRB as a **Layer validator** and earn rewards.

**Note:** This is a guide for setting up a Tellor Layer public testnet node. Care is taken to provide clarity on the tools being used, but testers should be comfortable with running experimental code via command line interface. A beginnerâ€™s understanding of the cosmos SDK is highly recommended!&#x20;

#### What is a Validator?&#x20;

Validators in the Tellor Layer network play a crucial role in maintaining the blockchain's integrity and consensus. They are responsible for validating transactions, securing the network, and ensuring the proper functioning of the blockchain.  The number of total validators is capped at 100.

**Responsibilities of a Validator:**

1. **Transaction Validation:** Validators validate transactions and add them to the chain.
2. **Consensus Participation:** They participate in the consensus mechanism to agree on the state of the chain.
3. **Block Proposal:** Validators propose new blocks and ensure that all committed transactions are included.
4. **Signing:** Validators sign aggregated data values, ensuring their correctness before they are relayed to other chains.
