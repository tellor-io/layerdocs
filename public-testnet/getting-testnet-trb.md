**Validators are required to stake.**  You will need to have some layer testnet TRB into your validator account (see step 7 in Running a node). Feel free to send a request in the public [discord](https://discord.gg/tellor) #testing-layer channel, or try the token bridge from the Sepolia testnet playground:
