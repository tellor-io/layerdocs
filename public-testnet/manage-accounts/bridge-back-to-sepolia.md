# Bridge back to Sepolia

1. Request withdraw of your tokens from layer to sepolia. In this example, the layer address is `tellor1suuc9d5dr5stps5tzjv5d95ur02827ardn5` and the ethereum address that we want to withdraw to is `0x7660794eF8f978Ea0922DC29B4d93e1fc94A`:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./layerd tx bridge withdraw-tokens tellor1suuc9d5dr5stps5tzjv5d95ur02827ardn5 7660794eF8f978Ea0922DC29B4d93e1fc94A 69010069loya --from YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME --fees 5loya
```
{% endcode %}

2. Copy the transaction hash of this withdraw-tokens transaction. We need to query the result and copy two pieces of information: the `query_id` and the `withdraw_id`

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# to get the queryId
./layerd query tx --type=hash <your_tx_hash> | grep -A 1 "query_id"

# to get the withdraw_id
./layerd query tx --type=hash <your_tx_hash> | grep -A 1 "withdraw_id"
```
{% endcode %}

Save these handy to be used later...

2. Wait 12 hours.

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:blue;">**While you wait, your withdraw request will automatically reported on layer.**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">**Next, we will find the timestamp of that report.**</mark>_
{% endhint %}

3. To find the timestamp of the aggregate report, use the query\_id from step 2:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./layerd query oracle get-current-aggregate-report <your_query_id_from_step_2>
```
{% endcode %}

This will print information about the report. Copy the timestamp for the next step.

4. Request attestations for your withdraw request report:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./layerd tx bridge request-attestations $TELLOR_ADDRESS <query_id_from_step2> <timestamp_from_step_3> --from $ACCOUNT_NAME --chain-id layertest-3 --fees 50loya --yes
```
{% endcode %}

5. Navigate to the block explorer's [bridge page](https://antietam.tellor.io/oracle-bridge). Paste in your withdraw request's Query ID and Timestamp and click the "Generate Oracle Proofs Below" button. (see screenshot below)

Keep this page open for the next step.

6. Call the `withdrawFromLayer` bridge function. Navigate to the [bridge contract.](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6ac02f3887b358591b8b2d22cfb1f36fa5843867#writeContract) Click on 6.withdrawFromLayer. Fill in the inputs with the values from the block explorer shown above, and click "Write".

You should recieve your tokens on Sepolia right away.
