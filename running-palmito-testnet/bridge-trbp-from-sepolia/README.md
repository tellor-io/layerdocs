# Bridging TRB to Tellor (palmito)

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">Important Info on Bridging:</mark>

* <mark style="color:blue;">**If you need Sepolia TRB, please make a request in the**</mark> [<mark style="color:blue;">**Tellor Discord**</mark>](https://discord.gg/kaMenz4ZVw)<mark style="color:blue;">**'s #testing-layer channel.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**There is no incentive to run this testnet. It is only for practicing the operation validators and reporters for mainnet.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**The amount that you can bridge is limited. Layer does not allow more than 5% of the supply to be bridged in a 12 hour period. If your bridge request is failing, try a smaller  \_amount, or wait for a time when the bridge is less congested.**</mark>
{% endhint %}
