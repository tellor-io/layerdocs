# Bridging to Tellor

### Prerequisites

* &#x20;Ethereum wallet with some [TRB](https://etherscan.io/token/0x88df592f8eb5d7bd38bfef7deb0fbc02cf3778a0?a=0x8cfc184c877154a8f9ffe0fe75649dbe5e2dbebf).
* A [recieving address](../manage-accounts.md) on Tellor layer.

### Navigate to [bridge.tellor.io](https://bridge.tellor.io/)

Click "Connect Wallet" and connect your Ethereum wallet.

Fill out the TRB field with the amount that you want to bridge to Tellor. Fill in the "to address" field with your tellor prefix account and approve the transaction in your wallet extension pop-up.

### Wait 12 hours

After a 12 hour security delay, your balance of TRB will arrive in your tellor wallet automatically. Congrats! This is a great time to pop into the [tellor discord ](https://discord.gg/tellor)and say hello!

### Secondary Method:

If the bridge page is ever unavailable, a block explorer like etherscan works fine. The instructions shown here are for testnet, but they work on the mainnet contracts as well.
