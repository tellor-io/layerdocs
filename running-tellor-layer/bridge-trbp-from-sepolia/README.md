# Bridging Sepolia TRB

{% hint style="success" %}
If you don't have any Sepolia TRB, Make a request in the [Tellor Discord](https://discord.gg/kaMenz4ZVw)'s `testing-layer` channel.

**Reminder: There is no incentive to run the testnet unless you want to be a validator and /or reporter on mainnet. TRB inflation is immutable.**
{% endhint %}

_**When you make a tellor bridge deposit request, that EVM event is reported on Tellor Layer by the data reporters running there. After a 12 hour wait, the balance should arrive in your tellor account.**_

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">N</mark><mark style="color:blue;">**ote: The amount that you can bridge is limited. Layer does not allow more than 5% of the supply to be bridged in a 12 hour period. If your bridge request is failing, try a smaller value for  \_amount.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

### Navigate to [bridge.tellor.io](https://bridge.tellor.io/)

2\) Fill out the TRB field with the balance of TRB that you want to bridge to Tellor Layer, add your receiving address on layer (starts with "tellor1"), and approve the Deposit.

4\. Wait 12 hours

While you're wait it's a great opportunity to join the [tellor discord ](https://discord.gg/tellor)and say hello!
