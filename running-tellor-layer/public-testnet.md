<mark style="color:orange;">**Note:**</mark> _This is a guide for setting up a Tellor Layer public testnet validator / reporter. Care is taken to provide info on the tools being used, but testers should be comfortable with running experimental code via command line interface. A beginnerâ€™s understanding of the cosmos SDK is highly recommended!_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">**Disclaimer:**</mark> participation in the Tellor Layer public testnet involves using experimental software. If used in a mainnet context, the commands in this documentation WILL have consequences for real funds. Proceed with caution and ensure that you understand the responsibilities and risks associated with participation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Never operate Tellor Mainnet validators with the same keys that you use for operating Tellor Testnet validators. In some edge situations, this results in permanent jailing and loss of funds due to bad validator attestations.**
